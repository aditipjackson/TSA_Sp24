## Setting R code chunk options

First R code chunk is used for setting the options for all R code chunks. The choice echo=TRUE means both code and output will appear on report, include = FALSE neither code nor output is printed.

```{r setup, include=FALSE} 
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE,tidy.opts=list(width.cutoff=80), tidy=FALSE) 
```

## Loading packages and initializing

Second R code chunk is for loading packages. By setting message = FALSE, the code will appear but not the output. 

```{r package, message=FALSE}
library(lubridate)
library(ggplot2)
library(forecast)
library(Kendall)
library(tseries)

```

## Importing data

Let's continue working with our inflow data for reservoirs in Brazil. 

```{r}

#Importing time series data from text file#
raw_inflow_data <- read.table(file="../Data/inflowtimeseries.txt",header=FALSE,skip=0)

#Trim the table to include only columns you need
nhydro <- ncol(raw_inflow_data)-2
nobs <- nrow(raw_inflow_data) 

#If your file does not have header like this one you can add column names after 
#creating the data frame
colnames(raw_inflow_data)=c("Month","Year", "HP1", "HP2","HP3","HP4", "HP5",
                            "HP6","HP7", "HP8","HP9","HP10", "HP11","HP12", 
                            "HP13", "HP14","HP15")

#Checking data
head(raw_inflow_data)
str(raw_inflow_data)
```
## Creating the date object

Here we use the function my() from package lubridate.

```{r}
#using package lubridate
my_date <- paste(raw_inflow_data[,1],raw_inflow_data[,2],sep="-")
my_date <- my(my_date)  #function my from package lubridate
head(my_date)
#add that to inflow_data and store in a new data frame 
inflow_data <- cbind(my_date,raw_inflow_data[,3:(3+nhydro-1)])
head(inflow_data)

```


## Initial Plots

Initial time series plot.

```{r}
#using package ggplot2
# using FOR loop to automate multiple plots
for(i in 1:nhydro){
  print(ggplot(inflow_data, aes(x=my_date, y=inflow_data[,(1+i)])) + # need to do 1+i to get accurate column data / keeping track of indexes... skips the date b/c date is in first column
          # if using ggpot within a forloop, need to use "print" function to get it to show up
            geom_line(color="blue") +
            ylab(paste0("Inflow ",colnames(inflow_data)[(1+i)],sep="")) 
        )
}

```

## Zeros in the end on data 

The initial plots showed that we have zeros in the end of the data set. It could be missing observation or observation that haven't been observed yet. Use the tail() to find out how many zeros you have and how many lines you will need to remove.

```{r}
#check the final obs on data 
tail(inflow_data)

# if there are zeros in beginning or end of data set, cut off 


```

Note our last observation is from August 2011 but the data file was filled with zeros. Let's remove the last four rows of our data set.

```{r}
#Remove last year by replacing current data frame
inflow_data <- inflow_data[1:(nobs-12),] #want rows to go from 1 to 972 

#update object with number of observations
nobs <- nobs-12 #subtract last 12 months (which represent the last year with incomplete data)

#Tail again to check if the rows were correctly removed
tail(inflow_data)
```
Fixed!

## Transforming data into time series object

Many of the functions we will use require a time series object. You can transform your data in a time series using the function *ts()*. 

```{r}
ts_inflow_data <- ts(inflow_data[,2:(2+nhydro-1)],start=c(1931,1),frequency=12) # selecting all columns from 2 to 16 and all rows
# 2 is where I'm starting, plus no. of nhydros that I have; could also do nhydro-1 b/c otherwise exceeding dataframe
#note that we are only transforming columns with inflow data, not the date columns  #start=my_date[1],end=my_date[nobs],
# start is an optional argument, but makes it more informed / organized
head(ts_inflow_data,15)
```


## Plotting ACF and PACF

Let's use functions Acf() and Pacf() from package "forecast".

```{r acf}
#Acf and Pacf for HP1
for(i in 1:nhydro){
  par(mfrow=c(1,2))  #place plot side by side
  Acf(ts_inflow_data[,i],lag.max=40,main=paste("Inflows HP",i,sep="")) 
  # because I am not storing Acf() into any object, I don't need to specify plot=TRUE 
  Pacf(ts_inflow_data[,i],lag.max=40,main=paste("Inflows HP",i,sep=""))
}


# par works with plot only, not ggplot or autoplot

```


## Trend Component - Linear Model

Let's identify and remove trend component. You start by fitting a linear model to $Y_t=\beta_0+\beta_1*t+\epsilon_t$. 

```{r}
#Create vector t that ranges from 1 to no. of obs
t <- 1:nobs

# selecting 1 power plant to work with; picked "4" b/c it seemed to have a trend...
iHP <- 4

#Fit a linear trend to TS of iHP, iHP+1 points to 5th column in dataset
# trying to find coefficients b0 and b1 using linear model
linear_trend <- lm(inflow_data[,(iHP+1)]~t)
summary(linear_trend)


# if you want to do a for loop, everything needs to be in the same r code chunk
# cannot index a dataframe by a forloop


```
# results telling us that inflow is increasing by 2.18 sec overtime; strong correlation between data set and time
# only 26% of variability in dataset is explained by time
# intercept is 637.55, beta 1 is 2.18



```{r}
#remove the trend from series
beta0 <- linear_trend$coefficients[1]
beta1 <- linear_trend$coefficients[2]

y_detrend <- inflow_data[,iHP-1] - (beta0+beta1*t)
# subtracting regression from original data set

df_detrend <- data_frame("date"=inflow_data$my_date,
                         "observed"=inflow_data[,iHP+1],"detrend"=y_detrend)

ggplot(df_detrend,aes(x=date))+
  geom_line(aes(y=observed),color="black")+
  geom_line(aes(y=detrend),color="blue")+
  labs(x="Date",y="Observations")

```

Note that blue line is our original series, red line is our trend, green line is our original series minus the trend or in other words the detrended series. And in orange is the trend line for the detrended series which has slope 0 meaning we were able to effectively eliminate the trend with a linear model.


# Check what happened to ACF after removing linear trend
```{r}
library(cowplot)
library(ggfortify)

ts_y_detrend <- ts(y_detrend,start=c(1931,1),frequency=12)

plot_gird(
  autoplot(ts_inflow_data[,iHP],ylab="Observed Inflow"),
  autoplot(ts_y_detrend)
)





# always looking at acf for trends; look at PACFs to find the value of the coefficients that we want to add to our model

# ideally want lag significance to go down! Means you have less elements to add to model... Basically able to decrease the time dependence from the series

# this may flip for moving-average models

# de-trending is reducing the time-dependence 

```


## Seasonal Component

Now let's shift attention to the seasonal component.

```{r}

#Let's choose another HP
iHP=1 

#Use seasonal means model
#First create the seasonal dummies
dummies <- seasonaldummy(ts_inflow_data[,iHP])  
#this function only accepts ts object, no need to add one here because date 
#object is not a column

#Then fit a linear model to the seasonal dummies
seas_means_model <- lm(inflow_data[,(iHP+1)]~dummies)
summary(seas_means_model)

#Look at the regression coefficient. These will be the values of Beta

#Store regression coefficients
beta_int <- seas_means_model$coefficients[1]
beta_coeff <- seas_means_model$coefficients[2:12]

#compute seasonal component
inflow_seas_comp <- array(0,nobs)
for(i in 1:nobs){
  inflow_seas_comp[i] <- (beta_int+beta_coeff %*% dummies[i,]) # "%*%" is doing the internal product of a matrix, doing element by element multiplication
}

#Understanding what we did
ggplot(inflow_data, aes(x=my_date, y=inflow_data[,(1+iHP)])) +
            geom_line(color="blue") +
            ylab(paste0("Inflow ",colnames(inflow_data)[(1+iHP)],sep="")) +
            geom_line(aes(y=inflow_seas_comp), col="red")


#Removing seasonal component
deseason_inflow_data <- inflow_data[,(1+iHP)]-inflow_seas_comp

#Understanding what we did
ggplot(inflow_data, aes(x=my_date, y=inflow_data[,(1+iHP)])) +
            geom_line(color="blue") +
            ylab(paste0("Inflow ",colnames(inflow_data)[(1+iHP)],sep="")) +
            geom_line(aes(y=deseason_inflow_data), col="green")


```

##Exercise

Fit trend and seasonal for the other variables HP2, HP3, ...


## Stationarity Tests in R

Some test only work for non-seasonal data. So let's create another series with yearly averages for inflow.

```{r}
#Group data in yearly steps instances


```

### Mann Kendall 

Check for deterministic trend.

```{r}

#Since I have seasonal data I cannot use the simple MannKendall()
#another example of functions that need a ts object


#Use yearly date to run Mann Kendall

```

### Spearman Correlation test 

Also check for deterministic trend, for non-seasonal data only.

```{r}
#Deterministic trend with Spearman Correlation Test
print("Results from Spearman Correlation")


#with cor.test you can get test statistics

```

### Augmented Dickey Fuller (ADF)

Used to detect stochastic trend.

```{r}
#Null hypothesis is that data has a unit root
print("Results for ADF test/n")

#Now let's try the yearly data
print("Results for ADF test on yearly data/n")

```

##Exercise

Run the stationarity tests for the other variables HP2, HP3, ...
